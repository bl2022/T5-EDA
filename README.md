## *Introduction*
Bike sharing systems have become popular means of travel in recent years, providing
a green and flexible transportation scheme to citizens in metropolitan areas. Many
governments in the world have seen this as an innovative strategy that could
potentially bring a number of societal benefits. For instance, it could reduce the use
of automobiles and hence reduce greenhouse gas emission and alleviate traffic
congestion in city centers.
